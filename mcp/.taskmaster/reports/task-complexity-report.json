			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Standard boilerplate setup for a Node.js TypeScript project. The requirements are explicit and standard (ESM, strict mode, specific dependencies), involving file creation and configuration rather than logic implementation."
		},

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement constants module with limits and allowlist",
			"complexityScore": 1,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Trivial implementation of a configuration file exporting static values. No dynamic logic or external dependencies involved."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Define shared CLI request and result types",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Defining TypeScript interfaces based on clearly outlined requirements. Low complexity as it defines the contract without implementation logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build agent-browser CLI execution service",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the CLI execution service into specific components: 1) A child_process spawner with timeout and signal handling, 2) An output processor that handles buffering, JSON parsing, and truncation limits, and 3) A security layer that sanitizes input paths and arguments before execution.",
			"reasoning": "This is a critical infrastructure component requiring robust error handling, process management (spawn/kill/timeout), stream buffering, output sanitization, and security checks (preventing path traversal). Failures here break the entire server."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Register core MCP tools for agent-browser interactions",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the tool registration into: 1) A helper function to map MCP arguments/Zod schemas to the internal CLI execution service arguments, and 2) The specific implementation and registration of the core tools (open, snapshot, click, type, fill) using the Model Context Protocol SDK.",
			"reasoning": "Requires mapping MCP tool calls to CLI arguments, defining precise Zod schemas, and handling the asynchronous nature of the CLI wrapper. There is moderate boilerplate but high importance on correctness of argument mapping."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Add navigation, session, CDP connect, and headers tools",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Similar pattern to Task 5 but likely simpler as these commands generally take fewer arguments. The complexity lies in ensuring the session/CDP logic aligns with the underlying CLI's behavior."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement advanced passthrough tool with allowlist guard",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Logic is straightforward (validation against a Set), but security implications raise the stakes slightly. It effectively reuses the service built in Task 4."

		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement MCP stdio server entrypoint",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Integration task to wire everything together. While simple in code volume, ensuring the stdio transport works correctly without pollution (e.g., console.logs leaking into the protocol stream) is vital."

			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Document installation and usage in README",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Documentation task. Requires clear explanation of the architecture and setup steps, but no coding complexity."
